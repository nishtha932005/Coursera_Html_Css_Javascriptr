                <h2>To My Life</h2>
                <p>
                Dearly I yearn for life's sweet embrace,
                Life's warm sunlight, my grace.<br>
                Life's gentle touch upon my face,<br>
                Moments of life, a cherished trace.<br>
                And I so embrace this life<br>
                For in its rhythm, I survive,<br>
                If I departed from this strife,<br>
                Life's essence would revive.<br>
                Place me, if I come anew,<br>
                As a breeze in your hair, let your laughter<br>
                Echo through the hills and dew,<br>
                Baptized by the joyous thereafter.<br>
                Bind us with a strand of time,<br>
                With moments strung from the fabric of days.<br>
                I could ascend to sublime heights,<br>
                Entrust my spirit to life's endless maze,<br>
                If I but touch the pulse of existence.<br>
                <br>
                Place me, if ever I return,<br>
                In the rivers that flow, a current untamed,<br>
                On the mountains, a silhouette unframed.<br>
                Feeble without life's rhythmic rhyme,<br>
                I can no longer chime.<br>
                <br>
                I am aged<br>
                Return to me the dreams of youth,<br>
                That I may navigate the path of truth,<br>
                Back with the drifting clouds,<br>
                Back to life's embrace, so proud.<br>
                <br>

                <h2>I Am Quiet</h2>
                <p>
                I am quiet and so is life.<br>
                Sipping moments with zest, while life sips strife.<br>
                That's the dance between us.<br>
                Like life, I wear colors broad and bright,<br>
                And like life, I read the script of the night.<br>
                Life doesn't see my silent gaze.<br>
                I don't see life's mysterious ways.<br>
                Life is quiet and so am I.<br>
                It poses questions to the universe.<br>
                I pose questions, a poetic converse…<br>
                A black cat strolls in the moonlight's gleam.<br>
                I feel the mystery of its fur,<br>
                And life feels the mystery of its stir…<br>
                I don't say to life: The world today<br>
                is clear and blue.<br>
                Life doesn't say to me: The world today is clear.<br>
                Life watches, and I watch back<br><br>
                and life is watched, and I am the watcher.<br>
                I move a step in life's grand plan.<br>
                Life moves a step in its eternal span.<br>
                I hum the melody of existence<br>
                and life hums the melody of its own subsistence.<br>
                I ponder: Is life the mirror reflecting me?<br>
                And turn to peer into its depths…but no reflections I see.<br>
                I leave the theatre of life.<br>
                I wonder: Maybe life's an actor…<br>
                or maybe a wanderer who thinks<br>
                I am a traveler.<br>
                Life is afraid…and so am I.<br>
                <br>

                <h2>I Come From Life</h2>
                <p>
                I come from life, a tapestry of memories<br>
                Born into moments, I have a journey<br>
                And a path with many turns,<br>
                I have challenges, joys,<br>
                And a window to the future's yearns.<br>
                Mine is the wave, dancing with the breeze,<br>
                I have my own perspective,<br>
                And an extra moment to seize.<br>
                Mine is the moon at the edge of dreams,<br>
                And the symphony of birds,<br>
                And the evergreen tree of life.<br>
                I tread this terrain before the storms<br>
                Turn its vibrant pulse into a dance floor.<br>
                <br>
                I come from life. I offer the sky to the day<br>
                When the day sings its vibrant display.<br>
                And I shed tears to make myself known<br>
                To a passing cloud, not alone.<br>
                I learned all the words that echo in the heart<br>
                So that I could play my part.<br>
                I learned all the words and rearranged them<br>
                To create a single word: Existence.....<br>
                <br>
